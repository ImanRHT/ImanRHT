### About Me
<p align='justify'>
  As a computer scientist specializing in networking, my primary research focus is directed toward applying AI/ML-driven solutions, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Federated Learning, and Meta Learning, to address the dynamic nature and complexities of Multi-Agent Systems in Wireless Communication Networks. In particular, I developed QECO: A QoE-Oriented Computation Offloading Algorithm based on DRL for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) and LSTM to enable distributed decision-making in uncertain MEC environments.

Currently, I have been working on three main research idea in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, which are as follows:

- **Multi-Agent DRL for Cooperative Task Offloading in Partially Observable MEC Environment**
- **Federated DRL for Continuous Improving Intradependente Task Offloading in MEC Network**
- **Meta-RL for Optimized Task Scheduling in Heterogeneous MEC**
