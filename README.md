### About Me

  As a computer scientist specializing in networking, my primary research focus is directed toward applying AI/ML-driven solutions, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Federated Learning, and Meta Learning, to address the dynamic nature and complexities of Multi-Agent Systems in Wireless Communication Networks. Specifically, I developed [QECO: A QoE-Oriented Computation Offloading Algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02525.pdf), which leverages Deep Q-Network (DQN) and LSTM to enable distributed decision-making in uncertain MEC environments.


Currently, I have been working on three main research idea in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, which are as follows:

- **Multi-Agent DRL for Cooperative Task Offloading in Partially Observable MEC Environment** [Research_Idea](https://ImanRHT.github.io/assets/MultiAgentDRL.pdf)
- **Federated DRL for Continuous Improving Intradependente Task Offloading in MEC Network**
- **Meta-RL for Optimized Task Scheduling in Heterogeneous MEC**
