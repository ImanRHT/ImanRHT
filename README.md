### About Me
<p align='justify'>
As a computer scientist specializing in networking, my research interests are directed toward applying AI/ML-driven solutions, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Federated Learning, and Meta Learning to address the dynamic challenges and complexities of Multi-Agent Systems in Wireless Communication Networks. My primary research focus lies in the area of Network Performance Optimization, particularly, I delved deeply into Computation Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, where dynamic nature of network adversely affect the system's performance. I had a chance to serve as a Research Assistant in the Performance and Dependability Laboratory in the Department of Computer Science at SUT, under the supervision of Prof. Ali Movaghar. During which, I formulated the long-term QoE maximization problem in MEC as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and designed a DRL-based algorithm that utilizes Deep Q-Network (DQN) and LSTM to provide distributed decisions in an uncertain MEC environment. This effort resulted in the development of my contribution, called QECO.

Currently, I serve as a Research Engineer in the Edge AI Laboratory at SUT in the Department of Electrical Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Hamed Shah-Mansouri. I have been working on three main research idea, which are as follows:
</p>

- Multi-Agent DRL for Cooperative Task Offloading in Partially Observable MEC Environment
- Federated DRL for Continuous Improving Intradependente Task Offloading in MEC Network
- Meta-RL for Optimized Task Scheduling in Heterogeneous MEC
