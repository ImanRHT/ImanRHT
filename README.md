### About Me

<p align='justify'>
As a computer scientist specializing in networking, I am fascinated by network performance optimization, particularly the integration of machine learning in mobile edge computing. My academic journey initially commenced in industrial engineering during my undergraduate studies, where I recognized the profound potential of computer science in addressing optimization problems. As a result, I shifted my academic path towards computer science. In my Master's program in computer science at Sharif University (SUT), while studying computer network, I became interested in distributed systems and computer performance evaluation. This interest shaped my research theme, culminating in the approval of my master's thesis titled “A Novel Resource Allocation Algorithm in Edge Computing with Deep Reinforcement Learning”. I have continued my research as a research assistant in the Performance and Dependability Lab at SUT, under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BXNelwwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Ali Movaghar</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dcjIFccAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Hamed Shah-Mansouri</a>. This experience has not only expanded my technical expertise, but also fueled my enthusiasm for research and equipped me with a robust foundation in these areas. I designed and implemented an algorithm leveraging deep reinforcement learning to optimize computation offloading decisions in mobile edge computing, aimed at enhancing the Quality of Experience (QoE) for end-users of mobile applications. This effort resulted in the development of my contribution – “<a href="https://github.com/ImanRHT/QOCO">QOCO</a>: A QoE-Oriented Computation Offloading Algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Edge Computing”. Throughout my professional endeavors, I have gleaned valuable insights into the strategic application of computational methods for understanding and optimizing intricate network systems. I am resolutely committed to expanding my current skill set and also eagerly embracing emerging interests in the networking domain.
