### About Me
<p align='justify'>
  As a computer scientist, specializing in networking, my primary research focus are directed toward applying AI/ML-driven solutions, like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Federated Learning, and Meta Learning to address the dynamic nature and complexities of Multi-Agent Systems in Wireless Communication Networks. Currently, I serve as a Research Engineer in the Edge AI Laboratory at SUT in the Department of Electrical Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Hamed Shah-Mansouri. I have been working on three main research idea, which are as follows:
