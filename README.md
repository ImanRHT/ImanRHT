### About Me
As a computer scientist specializing in networking, my primary research focus is directed toward applying AI/ML-driven solutions, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Federated Learning, and Meta Learning, to address the dynamic nature and complexities of Multi-Agent Systems in Wireless Communication Networks. I developed [[QECO]](https://github.com/ImanRHT/QECO) algorithm, a DRL-based QoE-Oriented Computation Offloading Algorithm for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which leverages Deep Q-Network (DQN) and LSTM to enable distributed decision-making in uncertain MEC environments. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02525.pdf)
  
Currently, I have been working on three main research idea in MEC systems, which are as follows:
- **Multi-Agent DRL for Cooperative Task Offloading in Partially Observable MEC Environment** [[Idea]](https://ImanRHT.github.io/assets/MultiAgentDRL.pdf)
- **Federated DRL for Continuous Improving Intradependente Task Offloading in MEC Network** [[Idea]](https://ImanRHT.github.io/assets/FederatedDRL.pdf)
- **Meta-RL for Optimized Task Scheduling in Heterogeneous MEC** [[Idea]](https://ImanRHT.github.io/assets/MetaRL.pdf)
